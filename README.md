# Nonconformance Analysis
Whenever a product or component is not up to standard at Hutchinson Aerospace and Industry, a Nonconformance Report (NCR) is generated and tracked in our company software. This project is to look at the number of NCRs each month, and to generate reports for the different manufacturing areas. 

This analysis helps the Manufacturing Engineering team identify which parts have the most problems so that they can focus their time improving these products. It also helps us track the effectiveness of process improvements over time.
