# Nonconformance Analysis
Whenever a product or component is not up to standard at Hutchinson Aerospace and Industry, a Nonconformance Report (NCR) is generated and tracked in our company software. This project is to look at the number of NCRs across 2023 and 2024, comparing the two years, and breaking the data down into different subsets to look at trends and patterns. 

This analysis helps the Manufacturing Engineering team identify which parts have the most problems so that they can focus their time improving these products. It also helps us track the effectiveness of process improvements over time.
